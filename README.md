The flag image just bigger, the name of the country, the capital city of that country, the currency, the google maps link(when clicked it will open the google maps in another tab in the browser), the continent, language and the time zone.
- NotFound: Display a 404 page for unknown routes.

3. API Endpoints:

- Fetch all countries: https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all
- Fetch a single country by name: https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/{name}
- Example: https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/united-states

4. Routing Setup:

- "/": Display the list of country cards and search input.
- "/country/": Display details for the selected country.
- "\*": Catch-all route for 404.

5. Search Functionality:

- Implement a search input to filter countries based on their names.

6. Styling:
